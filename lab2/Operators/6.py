x=(["banana" , "apple"])

#in - Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object

print( "banana" in x)
#Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object

#not in - Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object

print("banana" not in x)
