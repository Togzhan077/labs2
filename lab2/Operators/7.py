#Bitwise operators

#Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:

#&-and-Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
print(6&3)

#|-or-Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
print(6|3)

#^-xor-Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
print(6^3)

#~ - not -Inverts all the bits
print(~6)

#<< - Zero fill left shift (x<<2)
print(3<<2)

#>> - Signed right shift (x>>2)
print(3>>2)
