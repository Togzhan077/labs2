#join tuple

#To join two or more tuples you can use the + operator:
tuple1 = ("apple" , "banana")
tuple2 = ("orange" , "cherry")
tuple3= tuple1+tuple2
print(tuple3)

print("-")

#If you want to multiply the content of a tuple a given number of times, you can use the * operator:
tuple4 = tuple1 * 2
print(tuple4)
